# **Explain version control**

Version control is a system that tracks changes to a set of files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. It is particularly crucial in collaborative software development, but it can also be applied to any situation where tracking changes and managing different versions of files is necessary.


# **Explain difference between git and github**

Git is the version control system itself, used for tracking changes locally, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories along with collaboration and project management tools. You can use Git without GitHub, but GitHub leverages Git to provide a collaborative and centralized platform for teams to work together on projects.

# **Explain difference between git fetch and git pull**

Git fetch  is more explicit and gives you control over when to merge changes into your local branches,it is useful when you want to review changes before integrating them. while git pull is more automated and combines the fetch and merge steps, making it a quicker way to update your working copy.
